# Computer architecture projects

Projects developed throughout Computer Architecture classes.

This repository includes the following projects:

* Single-cycle MIPS 16bit processor able to execute 15 distinct instructions of type R, I and J, loaded onto a Basys3 board for live interactive simulation
* Multi-cycle MIPS 32bit processor able to execute R and I-type instructions simulated using test-benches in Vivado
* FIFO memory and Cache memory, AXI4-Stream Pipeline, implemented and simulated in Vivado
* Arithmetic Logic Unit performing addition and subtraction in 2's complement, logic operations, multiplication and division, with the possibility to use previous results as inputs, loaded and simulated live on Basys3
* Parking lot manager simulating a vacant parking space counting using sensors that detect the presence of cars at the entrance/exit and their moving direction
